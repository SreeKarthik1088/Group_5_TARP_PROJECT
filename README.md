# Group_5_TARP_PROJECT

This is our Project for Technical Answers for Real World Problems

India is well known for agriculture production. Huge population is dependent on agriculture. The  yield can be increased and quality can be improved by use of technology. Generally, whenever there is disease to a plant, we can say that leaves are the main indicator of the disease. The estimated potential yield losses caused by plant pathogens is up to 16% globally and most research in plant pathology aims to reduce yield loss in our crops directly or indirectly. 


Agricultural yield is vulnerable to various biotic stresses which incur significant losses in terms of reduced production. Food safety, nutrition, and agricultural economy are interlinked in a vicious cycle, which poorly affects the developing and underdeveloped countries and leads to health and economic problems. In many under-developed countries, major crop yield is produced by small farmers.
By the cause of Plant diseases have a huge effect on the agricultural productivity.

Image feature extraction and classification is a computer vision field that has been studied intensively by researchers due to its practical relevance for various scenarios, including that of precision agriculture.
The main purpose of this project is to detect the disease well in advance allowing  us to prevent a huge loss in terms of yield and money, by processing the images of the plant leaves.
